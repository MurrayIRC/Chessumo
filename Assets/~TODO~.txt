Feel:
    - you gotta give the piece movements more weight somehow. do the math.

Art:
    - Make sure Now typeface is free.
        - It is. I can use it.
    - Make the trail fade out behind the piece that's moving as it moves.

Saving Battery and Filesize:
    - Figure out how to reduce file size.
    - Convert all onmouse() functions to use touch input exclusively.

Known Bugs:
    - Can't reverse the knight movement path. Not crazy bug but would be a nice fix.

RELEASE CHECKLIST:
    - Fix how cramped the game looks on iPhone X. We will need to figure out tile and piece scaling finally. sigh...
    - Do a final sound pass. Remove all Convolution Reverb. Have sounds be terse instead of ringing out. Especially music notes / chords.

    - Test for bugs.
    - Do an about section with copyright references, special thanks, licensing info, etc.

    - Finish copywriting.
    - Soft launch in Australia.
