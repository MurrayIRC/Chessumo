Code Refactoring:
    - Maybe try fixing up game class and moving stuff out that doesn't need to be there.

Game Balancing:
    - Make it so if you get more than one off the board, the points you get are doubled.
        - This will put more of an emphasis on lining up pieces.
        - Only do this for getting 3 off the board.
    - Try taking away a piece and then making it so getting a piece off the board re-enables all the pieces on the board.

Add MENU and LEADERBOARD buttons to the game UI:
    - Right underneath the score and high score text fields.

Add an end to the game:
    - Shows a page ad.

Admob Integration (c):
    - interstitial ads after every game.
    - watch video ads to get closer to unlocking an ad-less version of the game.
        - the quantity watched of video ads must be worth more than it costs to pay for ad removal.

GameCenter Integration (c):
    - get a gamecenter id

Grid Size Testing:
    - Just try the game with a 4x4 grid and see how that feels.

Sound:
    - Very light sound design.
    - Reserved, just enough blips and blops to give it the cold, inhuman lifelessness it deserves.

Art:
    - Draw your own original piece icons.
    - Make sure Now typeface is free.
        - It is. I can use it.
    - Make the trail fade out behind the piece that's moving as it moves.

Company (c):
    - Incorporate
    - Protect through copyright

Tutorialization:
    - Save tutorial completion.
    - Little tutorial. Threes-esque, just very simple walkthrough of game rules.

Known Bugs:
    - Can't reverse the knight movement path. Not crazy bug but would be a nice fix.
    - Sometimes pushing pieces with the knight jumps the gun and a piece gets pushed prematurely
    - Pushing a piece off the board from > 1 space away by pushing another piece to the edge causes
      the jumping of the gun issue as well.
