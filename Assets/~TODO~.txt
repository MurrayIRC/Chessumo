UI:
    - have a little settings icon button in between the reset and leaderboard buttons
    - allow players to set conserve energy mode, run the tutorial again, etc.
    - check to see what it looks like when you make the board fit the width of the screen, just letting shit get cut off.

Feel:
    - make it so you can let go of a move past the board and it will still register as a move.
    - you gotta give the piece movements more weight somehow. do the math.

Add an end to the game:
    - Shows a page ad.

Admob Integration (c):
    - interstitial ads after every game.
    - watch video ads to get closer to unlocking an ad-less version of the game.
        - the quantity watched of video ads must be worth more than it costs to pay for ad removal.

GameCenter Integration (c):
    - Keep troubleshooting game center problems

Grid Size Testing:
    - Just try the game with a 4x4 grid and see how that feels.
    - It's ok. doesn't break the game.

Sound:
    - Very light sound design.
    - make it on the op-1

Art:
    - Draw your own original piece icons.
    - Fix the app logo. try a couple different permutations. one with like a grid of pieces, one with just the icon of the queen or something, etc.
    - Make sure Now typeface is free.
        - It is. I can use it.
    - Make the trail fade out behind the piece that's moving as it moves.

Company (c):
    - COPYRIGHT

Tutorialization:
    - Save tutorial completion.
    - Little tutorial. Threes-esque, just very simple walkthrough of game rules.

Saving Battery and Filesize:
    - Figure out how to reduce file size.
    - Convert all onmouse() functions to use touch input exclusively.

Known Bugs:
    - Can't reverse the knight movement path. Not crazy bug but would be a nice fix.
    - Sometimes pushing pieces with the knight jumps the gun and a piece gets pushed prematurely
    - Pushing a piece off the board from > 1 space away by pushing another piece to the edge causes
      the jumping of the gun issue as well.
