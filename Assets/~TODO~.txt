Feel:
    - you gotta give the piece movements more weight somehow. do the math.

Art:
    - Make the trail fade out behind the piece that's moving as it moves.

Saving Battery and Filesize:
    - Figure out how to reduce file size.

Known Bugs:
    - Can't reverse the knight movement path. Not crazy bug but would be a nice fix.
