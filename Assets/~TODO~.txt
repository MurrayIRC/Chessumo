Arrow-based Move System:
    - very much like fire emblem.
    - to me this seems like the best course of action for movement. easier to integrate into the system.
    - also will be less finicky with the weird move styles of the various pieces.
    - better for visual clarity tooooooooooo.

Code Refactoring:
    - fix up mode hierarchy

Game Balancing:
    - Make it so if you get more than one off the board, the points you get are doubled.
        - This will put more of an emphasis on lining up pieces.

Add an end to the game:
    - When you run out of moves, game should end.
    - All the tiles and pieces fall down (maybe adding a final amount of points to your score).
    - Score submitted to high score save if it's a high score.
    - Shows a page ad.

Make where the new pieces drop down deterministic:
    - They will drop randomly on the opposite side of where you pushed off a piece.
    - Actually wait. Maybe just keep it random.

Admob Integration:
    - interstitial ads after every game.
    - watch video ads to get closer to unlocking an ad-less version of the game.
        - the quantity watched of video ads must be worth more than it costs to pay for ad removal.

GameCenter Integration:
    - high scores and leaderboards, baby!
