Feel:
    - make it so you can let go of a move past the board and it will still register as a move.
    - you gotta give the piece movements more weight somehow. do the math.

UI:
    - next piece viewer should have an arrow underneath it, the box should be pointed to show more that the piece is going to drop in that row. give it the under-shadow too.

Add an end to the game:
    - Shows a page ad.

Admob Integration (c):
    - interstitial ads after every game.
    - watch video ads to get closer to unlocking an ad-less version of the game.
        - the quantity watched of video ads must be worth more than it costs to pay for ad removal.

GameCenter Integration (c):
    - Keep troubleshooting game center problems

Grid Size Testing:
    - Just try the game with a 4x4 grid and see how that feels.

Sound:
    - Very light sound design.
    - make it on the op-1

Art:
    - Draw your own original piece icons.
    - Fix the app logo. try a couple different permutations. one with like a grid of pieces, one with just the icon of the queen or something, etc.
    - Make sure Now typeface is free.
        - It is. I can use it.
    - Make the trail fade out behind the piece that's moving as it moves.

Company (c):
    - COPYRIGHT

Tutorialization:
    - Save tutorial completion.
    - Little tutorial. Threes-esque, just very simple walkthrough of game rules.

Known Bugs:
    - Can't reverse the knight movement path. Not crazy bug but would be a nice fix.
    - Sometimes pushing pieces with the knight jumps the gun and a piece gets pushed prematurely
    - Pushing a piece off the board from > 1 space away by pushing another piece to the edge causes
      the jumping of the gun issue as well.
