UI:
    - make the board a tiny bit bigger
    - turn the camera size to 5.25

Feel:
    - make it so you can let go of a move past the board and it will still register as a move.
    - you gotta give the piece movements more weight somehow. do the math.

    - Implement localization.

Grid Size Testing:
    - is 4x4 what we're going to go with here? i hope it's ok

Sound:
    - Very light sound design.

Art:
    - Draw your own original piece icons.
    - Fix the app logo. try a couple different permutations. one with like a grid of pieces, one with just the icon of the queen or something, etc.
    - Make sure Now typeface is free.
        - It is. I can use it.
    - Make the trail fade out behind the piece that's moving as it moves.
