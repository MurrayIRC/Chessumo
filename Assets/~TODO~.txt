UI:
    - make the board a tiny bit bigger
    - turn the camera size to 5.25

Feel:
    - you gotta give the piece movements more weight somehow. do the math.

Art:
    - Fix the app logo. try a couple different permutations. one with like a grid of pieces, one with just the icon of the queen or something, etc.
    - Make sure Now typeface is free.
        - It is. I can use it.
    - Make the trail fade out behind the piece that's moving as it moves.

Saving Battery and Filesize:
    - Figure out how to reduce file size.
    - Convert all onmouse() functions to use touch input exclusively.
