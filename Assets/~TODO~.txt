UI:
    - make the board a tiny bit bigger

Feel:
    - make it so you can let go of a move past the board and it will still register as a move.
    - you gotta give the piece movements more weight somehow. do the math.

GameCenter Integration (c):
    - Game Center works now I guess.
    - Implement localization.

Grid Size Testing:
    - is 4x4 what we're going to go with here? i hope it's ok

Sound:
    - Very light sound design.

Art:
    - Draw your own original piece icons.
    - Fix the app logo. try a couple different permutations. one with like a grid of pieces, one with just the icon of the queen or something, etc.
    - Make sure Now typeface is free.
        - It is. I can use it.
    - Make the trail fade out behind the piece that's moving as it moves.

Company (c):
    - COPYRIGHT

Tutorialization:
    - Draw tutorial pages using Sketch

Saving Battery and Filesize:
    - Figure out how to reduce file size.
    - Convert all onmouse() functions to use touch input exclusively.

Localization:
    - Find and implement chinese / japanese / whatever character fonts.

Known Bugs:
    - Can't reverse the knight movement path. Not crazy bug but would be a nice fix.
    - Sometimes pushing pieces with the knight jumps the gun and a piece gets pushed prematurely
    - Pushing a piece off the board from > 1 space away by pushing another piece to the edge causes
      the jumping of the gun issue as well.
