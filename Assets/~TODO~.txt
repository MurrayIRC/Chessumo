Arrow-based Move System:
    - very much like fire emblem.
    - to me this seems like the best course of action for movement. easier to integrate into the system.
    - also will be less finicky with the weird move styles of the various pieces.
    - better for visual clarity tooooooooooo.

Code Refactoring:
    - Maybe try fixing up game class and moving stuff out that doesn't need to be there.

Game Balancing:
    - Make it so if you get more than one off the board, the points you get are doubled.
        - This will put more of an emphasis on lining up pieces.
        - Only do this for getting 3 off the board.
    - Try taking away a piece and then making it so getting a piece off the board re-enables all the pieces on the board.

Add MENU and LEADERBOARD buttons to the game UI:
    - Right underneath the score and high score text fields.

Add an end to the game:
    - Shows a page ad.

Make where the new pieces drop down deterministic:
    - They will drop on the opposite side of where you pushed off a piece.
    - Don't do this. You'll get into loops where people will just get continuous lines.

Admob Integration:
    - interstitial ads after every game.
    - watch video ads to get closer to unlocking an ad-less version of the game.
        - the quantity watched of video ads must be worth more than it costs to pay for ad removal.

GameCenter Integration:
    - high scores and leaderboards, baby!

Grid Size Testing:
    - Just try the game with a 4x4 grid and see how that feels.

Sound:
    - Very light sound design.
    - Reserved, just enough blips and blops to give it the cold, inhuman lifelessness it deserves.

Art:
    - Draw your own original piece icons.
    - Make sure Now typeface is free.

Company:
    - Incorporate
    - Protect through copyright

Tutorialization:
    - Save tutorial completion.
    - Little tutorial. Threes-esque, just very simple walkthrough of game rules.

Known Bugs:
    - Right now you can select a piece while another is still moving. Disallow this.
        - Did it a little bit, but this surfaced a bug.
        - Pieces that go a distance greater than 1 somehow just reset after one move.
        - Fix this by doing the continuous tween feature that you're planning on implementing.
    - Tiles lower immediately when a piece is moving more than one tile.
    - Piece selection sprite doesn't deselect when we move certain pieces.
