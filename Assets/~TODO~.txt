Feel:
    - you gotta give the piece movements more weight somehow. do the math.

Art:
    - Make sure Now typeface is free.
        - It is. I can use it.
    - Make the trail fade out behind the piece that's moving as it moves.

Saving Battery and Filesize:
    - Figure out how to reduce file size.

Known Bugs:
    - Can't reverse the knight movement path. Not crazy bug but would be a nice fix.

RELEASE ROADMAP:
    - Finalize the website and its presskit.
    - Fix how cramped the game looks on iPhone X. We will need to figure out tile and piece scaling finally. sigh...
    - Do a final sound pass. Remove all Convolution Reverb. Have sounds be terse instead of ringing out. Especially music notes / chords.
    - Test for bugs.
    - Get marketing campaign ready. (maybe) adwords, twitter, instagram, facebook. This requires working with dad for budget.
    - Set up app store page.
    - Draft Press Emails.
    - Finish copywriting.
    - Soft launch in Australia.
    - Localize GameCenter Leaderboards.
    - Find and implement chinese / japanese / whatever character fonts. Localize.
